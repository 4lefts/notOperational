I remembered I own a couple of [fm3 buddha machines](http://www.fm3buddhamachine.com/v2/).


It's surprising how much freedom there is in a few well-made loops, a pitch and a volume control (and the original buddha machine didn't even let you control pitch).

Anyway, [this experiment](http://notoperational.com/lhasa) is me trying to make something similar in the browser. It will probably be nothing like it. Plus the loop I'm using at the moment is not well made. I need to make some loops. A work in progress.

As always, built with [p5 js](https://p5js.org), and [Tone js](https://tonejs.github.io/). As a side note, this app is my first go at using Webpack rather than Gulp to bundle/transpile javascript.
