![process p](/images/process.PNG)

I got two for the price of one with this one. As always, I used [p5 js](https://p5js.org), and [Tone js](https://tonejs.github.io/) to build [Process-M](http://notoperational.com/process-m) and [Process-P](http://notoperational.com/process-p). They're obviously very similar, even though they do very different things.

I link the idea in process-m of playing a given note based on a probability on each step. Something to explore further, with a view to making self-playing, ambient sonic web-apps.
