The other day I got an [RC2014](http://rc2014.co.uk) in the post. The specific kit I got was the [RC2014 Mini](http://rc2014.co.uk/modules/rc2014-mini/). It's an 8-bit computer based on the z80 microprocessor, and comes with Grant Searle's Microsoft BASIC written onto the first 8KB of it's ROM, so it should be good to go. It's detailed [here](http://searle.hostei.com/grant/z80/SimpleZ80.html#RomBasic), on his rather excellent site.

I'm too young to have had a z81 when I was little (according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81) they were discontinued when I was 4), but I guess this computer will be similar in some ways. It has 32KB RAM though, rather than the 1KB that the z81 came with. Onward.

## Assembly

The kit comes with pretty good instructions. They're printed on black and white, which is fair enough, but means that you can't tell what colour the resistors are in the pics. Fortunately, there's a colour version on the [RC2014 Mini page](http://rc2014.co.uk/modules/rc2014-mini/), so you can't really go far wrong.

First, solder in the sockets for the ICs and crystal:

Then the caps...

... and the resistors. Take your time with this; I imagine it would be easy to mix up the colours, if, like me, you don't spend a lot of time around charts of resistor colour codes.

Next, put in the reset switch, power LED and the power barrel connector. I made a bit of the a hash of this - it's the only bit that's not quite straight (though only by a tiny bit). Fortunately, you can't see the fluxy mess on the other side of the board, and anyway, bokeh covers a multitude of sins.

ICs installed. Bending the pins on the z80 chip gave me some sweaty palms, but that's just me not being used to it, I imagine.

## First Boot

I fitted the 2x20 pin female header to use a Raspberry Pi Zero as a terminal emulator and graphics card, via the PiGFX bare metal image for the Pi, which can be found [here](https://github.com/fbergama/pigfx). The instructions for the RC2014 recommended using an FTDI cable first, but I haven't got one and I have got Pi Zero. Amazingly easy to set up thanks to the excellent instructions in the readme.

First boot! I can't believe it worked first time! Credit to the great instructions. An all round great kit. Now... how to use a 3.5" floppy drive with it...
